Creating a Data Model for AquaVolt Solutions

As Data Engineers for AquaVolt Solutions, the students have to design a structured data model from a CSV file supplied by the client. From this raw data, they will have to identify and extract the information needed to create several tables that meet AquaVolt Solutions' needs.

AquaVolt Solutions, a company specialising in energy solutions, needs to structure its data to optimise the analysis and reporting of its activities.

Currently, the data is centralised in a single CSV file, making it complex to use. AquaVolt wants a well-structured data model, made up of several tables providing a clearer view of distinct entities (products, customers, contracts, etc.).

This data model will serve as a basis for better management and use of the information, particularly for the marketing and customer management teams.
